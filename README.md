## Setup Instructions

### Backend (FastAPI)
1. Navigate to the `server` folder
2. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the server:
```
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
4. Make sure `/uploads` folder exists for image storage

### Frontend (React)
1. Navigate to the `client` folder
2. Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```
3. Run the frontend:
```
npm start
```

##  Design Choices
- **One-to-many relationship**: A pod can have multiple photos â€” modeled via foreign key in `photos` table
- **Image storage**: Images are stored on disk in `/uploads/` folder with unique filenames to prevent collisions
- **API design**: RESTful principles with clean, resource-focused endpoints
- **Frontend simplicity**: Focused on usability with clear image previews and upload flows

---

## Assumptions
- No authentication or user accounts
- Image format assumed to be JPEG or PNG
- All pods are public and stored locally
